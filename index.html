<h1>My Resume</h1>

<img height="200" src="./ErickGranados.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
        I'm learning web development to first learn all the basics, get a nice job and then <br> 
        learn Game Development, since I'm making a board game!
    <h2>Education</h2>
        I finished Highschool in Mexicali, Mexico and I didn't go to college, everything <br> 
        that I learned was at work or courses like sales, mixology, and my insurance licence. 
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        I have worked in Mexicali, Calexico, the Coachella Valley, Las Vegas, Alaska, Texas and more. <br>
        Here are my current and previous relevant positions:
        
            <h4>Insurance Sales Agent at American Income Life.</h4>
                <p>Currently I'm selling Health & Life insurance with AIL and we specialize in union members, we make sure <br>
                that they get their supplemental benefits and guide them through registration and answer all their <br>
                questions so they are fully aware of their benefits. I do this in Spanish and English.</p>
                
            <h4>Onboarding Specialist at UENI</h4>
                <p>I present customers their requested website. <br>
                I show them how they are, how they work and how to edit it. I answer their questions during the <br>
                presentation and I have up to 8 calls a day via Zoom with customers. <br>
                Most of the times the customers speak english but some of them want to have the presentation in <br>
                Spanish.</p>
            
            <h4>Gaming Support at 5CA in the Epic Games division.</h4>
                <p> I did billingual customer support for gamers in the Epic Games area. I was in charge of helping the players <br>
                with their needs, like refunds, errors in the game, account changes and more! <br>
                Also we would play Fortnite once a week.
                </p>
        
    <h2>Skills</h2>
        I'm going to list not only serious and functional skills, but also a couple of my <br>

            </li>
            <li><strong>Learning:</strong> I studied 2 years worth of french at Lingua Planet in Merida, Yucatan <br>

            <li><strong>Teaching:</strong> I'm not a teacher per say, but I have studied the process of teaching and learning, <br>
